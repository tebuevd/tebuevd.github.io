          There are three fees collected by various parties each time you swipe
          your credit card:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
          <li class="leading-7 transition-all duration-100 hover:tracking-wide">
            interchange fee
          </li>
          <li class="leading-7 transition-all duration-100 hover:tracking-wide">
            scheme fee
          </li>
          <li class="leading-7 transition-all duration-100 hover:tracking-wide">
            acquirer fee
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The interchange fee goes to the
          <span class="italic">issuing bank</span>, which is the bank that
          issued the card to the customer. For example, when somebody uses a
          "Chase Sapphire Preferred" card, the interchange fee goes to J.P.
          Morgan Chase.
        </p>

          Even though Visa does not keep the interchange fee, it has the power
          to set it. Visa decides what the interchange fee is and the fee is
          different across its products (Visa, Visa Signature, Visa Infinite,
          etc.), merchant categories (Retail, Travel, Hospitality, etc.), and
          other factors. Visa updates these rates several times a year and as of
          the time of writing the latest rates can be seen

          So what does Visa collect for itself?
          <span class="italic">The scheme fee</span>. This fee is not revealed
          publicly, but I've heard on podcasts that it is in the range of
          0.2%-0.3% of the transaction.
