          Business models in consumer fintech
        </h1>
        <p class="">
          There are only 5 common business models in consumer fintech. They are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>Net interest income</li>
          <li>Credit/debit card interchange</li>
          <li>Loans</li>
          <li>Fees</li>
          <li>Subscriptions</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="">Despite the jargon, these are simple to understand.</p>

        <section class="">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Net Interest Income</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            You keep money in an account and the company takes your money,
            invests it in money market funds, and earns interest (yield).
            Sometimes the company shares some of this yield with you, sometimes
            they don't. This revenue tends to be pure profit for them - there
            are approximately zero costs to moving customer deposits into
            short-term, risk-free monetary instruments.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4">
            Due to the higher interest rate regime in the US from 2022-2024, net
            interest income is a non-trivial share of several companies'
            revenues:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
            <li>Coinbase - $278.6M in Q3 2024</li>
            <li>Robinhood - $46M in Q3 2024</li>
            <li>Sofi - [To be filled in]</li>
            <li>Cash App - [To be filled in]</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Credit/debit card interchange</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Every time you use your credit or debit card, the issuer gets
            between ~1-2% of the amount in revenue [2]. Some issuers will rebate
            a portion of that as cash back, points, miles etc and keep the rest.
            The exact take is hard to know and depends on the type of card used,
            purchase category, whether the issuer is "Durbin-exempt", and the
            negotiated rate the fintech has with their card issuer. The last
            point is worth elaborating on - most fintechs with debit/credit
            cards are not technically banks and therefore rely on partner banks
            to issue the card.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Loans</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            I'm grouping several types of loans under this umbrella. The premise
            is simple - you're borrowing money and paying interest on the amount
            owed. The mechanism are varied: margin loan against your stock
            portfolio, credit card balance, personal/student/car/mortage loans
            etc. etc. Interest rates can be fixed or variable, the loans may be
            amortized (you start paying back the principal right away) or not
            (you only pay interest for the duration of the loan and then pay
            back the principal as a lump sum at the end). A interest-only
            period, followed by amortization is also possible. The institution
            will earn an origination fee and a spread on the interest paid by
            you and the interest paid by them (they're not using their own
            capital, they're borrowing from someone else and lending to you at a
            markup).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Fees</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Another broad category. Depending on company's specialization they
            may charge different fees. These can be: trading fees (Coinbase),
            foreign transaction fees, transfer fees (same-day withdrawals, wires
            etc), miscellaneous fees (overdraft, account maintenance fees), cash
            withdrawal fees, assets-under-management (AUM) fee etc. The industry
            has been shifting away from fees due to a mix of competitive
            pressures (eg Robinhood's fee-free trading, Chime removing all fees)
            and regulation (<a
              href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-close-bank-overdraft-loophole-that-costs-americans-billions-each-year-in-junk-fees/"
              class="text-blue-600 hover:underline"
              >CFPB Junk Fees Proposal</a
            >). But despite that, this category remains substantial - overdraft
            fees alone are estimated to be ~$9 billion per year.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Subscriptions</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            This is becoming more common today as fintechs choose to forego more
            revenue from the previous categories for customers who pay a
            membership fee. Examples include Robinhood Gold, Coinbase One,
            Mercury Personal.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Long Tail</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The above five categories are not the only ways to make money in
            fintech, just some of the most common. A future article will talk
            about the long tail â€” a far more interesting space in my opinion.
          </p>
        </section>

        <p class="mb-4">
          As an exercise for the reader, I recommend opening your favorite
          banking/brokerage/payments app and bucketing where you think the
          revenue falls into. It's surprisingly easy and given the
          <em>fintech convergence</em> (a topic for a future article) in the
          last 10 years, each company has a mix of income from several of these
          categories. This exercise isn't just fun, it also helps one understand
          their relationship with the firm, and the balance of that
          relationship. It's also a way to identify deals that are "too good to
          be true" and are likely to be finite in length or even may be short
          term.
